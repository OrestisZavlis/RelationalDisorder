# A generative model of personality disorder as a relational disorder

## Introduction
This repository includes code on a model that formalizes (static) personality disorders as (dynamic) relational disorders. The model is based on the computational process of mental inference: that is, inferring the mental states that are likely to have caused one's observed behaviour. Psychologically, this process is known as mentalizing (i.e., 'thinking about thinking'; Fonagy, 1991). According to traditional psychoanalytic (e.g., object relational) and contemporary socio-cognitive (e.g., attachment and interpersonal) perspectives, mentalizing impairments are fundamental to our understanding of personality (and its putative pathology). The model embraces these perspectives and suggests that personality disorers can be more formally (and perhaps also ethically) understood as relational disorders: disorders of maladaptive relatedness to oneself and others. Below, I outline this model of mental inference. 

## Mental Inference

The figure above outlines a probabilistic graph: that is, a graph that outlines how a set of (random) variables cause (with causality being indicated by the directed arrows). 

To start from the highest to the lowest levels of this hierarchy, this generative architecture implies that (1) internal working models of the self and others generate (2) mental states of the self and others, which in turn (3) generate observed behaviours of the self and others. Psychologically, this process of mental inference can be recast as follows: internal working models (which have their roots in temperament and one's social experience) dictate the probability of evoking (or _fantasizing_, or _generating_) particular mental states to be used as _hypotheses_ in order to explain behaviour from oneself or others.
