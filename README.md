# A generative model of personality disorder as a relational disorder

## Introduction
This repository includes code on a model that formalizes (static) personality disorders as (dynamic) relational disorders, using the computational process of mental inference. The idea that personality disorders can be viewed as mentalizing / object relational disorders has its roots in traditional psychoanalytic theories that viewed personality ... 

## Mental Inference

The figure above outlines a probabilistic graph: that is, a graph that outlines how a set of (random) variables are conditioned on one another. To start from the highest to the lowest levels of this hierarchy, this generative architecture implies that (1) internal working models of the self and others generate (2) mental states of the self and others, which in turn (3) generate observed behaviours of the self and others. Psychologically, this process of mental inference can be recast as follows: internal working models (which have their roots in temperament and one's social experience) dictate the probability of evoking (or _fantasizing_, or _generating_) particular mental states to be used as _hypotheses_ in order to explain behaviour from oneself or others.
